Dashboard => Manage Jenkins => Script Console

def jobName = "JOB_FOLDER_NAME"  
def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem(jobName)  
job.getBuilds().each { it.delete() }  
job.nextBuildNumber = 1   
job.save()


/ OR /

def jobName = "myProjectFolder/subFolder/myJobName"
def job = Jenkins.getInstance().getItemByFullName(jobName, Job.class)
job.getBuilds().each { it.delete() }  
job.nextBuildNumber = 1   
job.save()


/OR/ run below code for all jobs where only keep last 10 or MAX_BUILD=x value build number

import jenkins.model.Jenkins
import hudson.model.Job

MAX_BUILDS = 10
Jenkins.instance.getAllItems(Job.class).each { job ->
  println job.name
  def recent = job.builds.limit(MAX_BUILDS)
  for (build in job.builds) {
    if (!recent.contains(build)) {
      println "Preparing to delete: " + build
      //build.delete()
    }
  }
}
